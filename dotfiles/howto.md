# How to use dotfiles
In this directory I put dotfiles that I really like to use

## Starship
To install starship go to: [Starship installation page](https://starship.rs/guide/#%F0%9F%9A%80-installation) and follow the installation
To activate `starship.toml`:
- Install the file first
- You have to install [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) if you want to use cool icons
- Add path to the `starship.toml` file as a environment variable with name "STARSHIP_CONFIG". Example on linux:
```sh
export STARSHIP_CONFIG=~/this/is/the/directory/starship.toml
```
