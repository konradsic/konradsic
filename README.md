# 🖐️ Hi! Let Me introduce myself
I'm Konrad but you could know me as **@konradsic** or **@Konradoo**. 
I really like programming - thats what I want to do in the future. After all I also play games such as Minecraft and Cities: Skylines

## 📦 What I am working on
Here is a short list of projects that I've been recently working on (updated 6.10.22)
* [DJ Cloudy - A discord bot that will make your server better](https://github.com/konradsic/dj-cloudy)
* I gave up on this project, but [PyEconomy - Economy system made easier](https://github.com/konradsic/py-economy)

~~I don't really have a big commit history in those projects because I am participating in programming contests that take so much time from my life~~

## 📨 Contact me
* Via discord: **Konradoo#6938**
